# IT study
IT study is a silly small webapp that allows users to register for courses and create courses of their own so other users will get registered.

This repo holds the REST API back-end implementation code (with nestjs) for the webapp

All the REST API call routes are documented in the `documentation/it_study_REST_routes.json` file. This fiel is exported from 	[insomnia](https://www.insomnia.rest)

## setup

in order to test this project on your machine, first clone this repo and make sure to install all the dependancies by running `yarn install` or `npm run install` in the root directory. 

(You will need node, nestCli and yarn or npm installed in the first place)
